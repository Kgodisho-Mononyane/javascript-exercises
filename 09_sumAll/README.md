# Exercise 09 - sumAll

Implement a function that takes 2 positive integers and returns the sum of every integer between (and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```


## Hints

Think about how you would do this on pen and paper and then how you might translate that process into code:

- return the sum after finishing the loop
